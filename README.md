# PwCDemo

This is a fun little bow-and-arrow style demo I put together for a technical evaluation over a weekend. I implemented a lot more than was asked for in the prompt but I had a lot of fun with it.

## Getting Started

An apk can be found in the BuildsAndVideos directory that allows sideloading the application onto a Quest 2. If you don't have a headset, I also recorded a capture of the experience and put it in that same directory.

## Controls

To move around the scene, you can hold down either the left or right trigger to bring up the teleport controls. A projectile curve will appear with a preview of the target location highlighted on the ground. Simply release the trigger to teleport to the highlighted spot.

To pick up objects such as the bow or arrow, aim the lasers from the hand controllers at until the beams turn white and then and squeeze the grip, and the hovered object will snap into the hand.

To shoot an arrow, it must be nocked on the bowstring by bringing the back of the arrow to the bowstring. Once it is nocked, pull the string back and release the grip to fire. If you want to practice your aim, look around for the target with the "Practice Target" label hovering over it. This target can be shot without despawning. Once you have the hang of it, you can shoot the gallery target to begin a round. See how many targets you can hit, and how high of a score you can rack up!

## Code Sample

The code I wrote can be found in the "Assets\PwC Demo\Scripts" directory. 

If you want to see how I organized my thoughts, you can view the Trello board I utilized to manage my time [HERE](https://trello.com/b/YSrThxVC/agile-sprint-board). I didn't quite get to everything I wanted to do, but what I was able to get done over the weekend is a solid representation of my abilities.

## Hardware

This was prototyped with the Meta Quest 2 in mind since that's what I had available to me. I'm not sure how well this prototype will function on other VR headsets
